NAME
    Var::State - Static variable in perl 5.8

VERSION
    0.05

SYNOPSIS
     use Var::State;

     sub foo {
         static my $i = 0;
         return $i++;
     }

     print foo() for(0..10); # will print 0 to 10

FUNCTIONS
  static(var)
    Does almost the same as "state" in 5.10, but it requires the variable to
    be declared with "my". See "SYNOPSIS" for example.

    This function does support list context, something "state" in 5.10 does
    not support.

  state
    See LIMITATIONS.

  import
    Will import "static()" into the current namespace.

LIMITATIONS
    Need to add "state" as a keyword, so you don't have to declare the
    variable with "my()" first. This exact problem breakes compatibility
    with 5.10's state, and therefore "t/11-state-5.10.t" is not included in
    the test-suite.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs or feature requests to "bug-var-state at
    rt.cpan.org", or through the web interface at
    <http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Var-State>. I will be
    notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on your
    bug as I make changes.
